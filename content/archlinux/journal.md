## Test Emacs {#test-emacs}

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 240404-1
:EXPORT_DATE: 2024-04-04
:END

Today, I test emacs more. I can't open file, can't install packages.
I only install yasnippet, Lsp-bridge.
I can recognize about keybinding, how to install packages from package manager better than ever before.
But concern with org-mode, I forget many tips, keybind. so worth than ever before.

I think it is waste so much if I use only either emacs or vim. The more I use these, it become more interesting. And, The text editer is not only these two. We have vscode, Helix, kakoune. I have interest about kakoune. I will try it.

Repair i3 solution. When I open i3 in WSL, text is blur. In vsxrc's property, check high solution, and restart. It works very well. And install font hackgen, config emacs to use hackgen font. It looks so good!

I want to write about trouble or issues. But I can't take time for this.

Time is my un overcome enemy.

#### Exploring Yankpad and Org-mode {#exploring-yankpad-and-org-mode}

Yesterday, I installed Yankpad, a handy package for Emacs that allows me to insert snippets, including code blocks, into various buffers and files. I'm particularly excited about its ability to easily insert code blocks into Org files, as this will streamline my workflow.

In addition to code snippets, Yankpad can also handle a wide range of text snippets, such as boilerplate email templates. Today, I plan to create a set of snippets specifically for email templates, which should save me a lot of time and effort in the long run.

Another aspect of Org-mode that I'm exploring is literate programming. I've created an Emacs configuration file in Org format (config.org) and have been experimenting with executing Org-babel to generate the corresponding config.el file. This process has been surprisingly straightforward, thanks to Org-mode's powerful capabilities.

One feature that I find particularly useful is the ability to selectively tangle (execute) code blocks within the Org file. By setting the tangle property to "no" for specific blocks, I can omit them from the generated config.el file. This flexibility allows me to include code snippets for reference purposes without necessarily executing them.

\## Embracing Emacs and Org-mode

Initially, I had considered using Neovim, as it seemed like a more modern and "cooler" option compared to Emacs. However, after spending some time with Org-mode and experiencing its powerful features firsthand, I've come to appreciate the superiority of Emacs in this domain.

Org-mode's capabilities for task management, note-taking, and literate programming have won me over, and I've decided to fully embrace Emacs as my primary text editor and productivity tool. While Neovim may have its strengths, the depth and versatility of Org-mode make Emacs an unbeatable choice for my workflow.

As I continue to delve deeper into Emacs and Org-mode, I'm excited to uncover more hidden gems and streamline my productivity even further.

Exhausted day, today. I fixes LP. But I don't understand why I can center text, why I can display: flex, why contests over rides fixed bar above. Perhaps transcend.

I took over time to fix it. And not at all problem yet.

What should I do after Denver l dinner. A little rust, org mode, and so on. Today I can't create any snippets. I could do today are fix control Skk. It would be comfort to texting. But I text by English increase. It easy because no need to change to kanji.

I added the priority to my tasks in my org-agenda. Since yesterday,I didn't add any priorities. It happened I didn't start important tasks and did from easy to proceed tasks. But of course It occurred bad thing.
I evaluate tasks of this importance.

today, I watched a movie about denote. It occrured me how to write the denote.
It can write jouranl. I wrote every journal in org-capture.

But I knew about denote-journal. Which should I use org-capture journal or denote-journal?

Let's test denote-journal.
I want to watch more video about denote.

I forget. I watched about meta note. I must create 'the meta-note'.
This above is sample note. it's not metanote. I think I use a `refile.org` .
I correct onto the file to all of my note.

It heard ridiculas? Yes, I think so. But many people do so.

-  How can I change a bunch of text  like above, by using regular expression?

<!--list-separator-->

-  Chat GPT

<!--list-separator-->

-  Yes, you can achieve this transformation using Emacs's find and replace functionality with regular expressions. Here's how you can do it:

    1.  Open your text file in Emacs.
    2.  Press \`Ctrl + %\` `query-replace-regexp` to initiate the search and replace operation.
    3.  Emacs will prompt you for the text or regular expression to search for. Enter the regular expression that matches the patterns you want to replace. For example, to match lines starting with "prop.", you can use `^prop\..*?$`.
    4.  Press \`Enter\`.
    5.  Emacs will prompt you for the replacement text. Enter the replacement string with the desired formatting, using `\&` to refer to the entire matched text. For example, to replace the matched lines with `**** \&`, enter that as the replacement string.
    6.  Press \`Enter\` again to perform the replacement.

    Repeat steps 3-6 for each pattern you want to replace, adjusting the regular expressions and replacement strings as needed. Remember to use regular expression syntax for your patterns, and escape special characters as necessary.

<!--list-separator-->

-  I

    But, It was not enough. I added few regexp and done.

    ```nil
    \*\*\*\* PROP \. [A-Z]+\. -> \& ^J(press C-q,C-j)
    ```

    It can change to return and make sentence. `\&` means refer to the entire matched text.

I faced emacs cpu usage 100% problem.
emacs became very slow.
so I check cpu usage, and emacs's cpu usage is 100%,
and many python3 running.
I can't say correctly, however 3 result of org-babel code block
including RESULT.
I deleted some code block including RESULT from file.
and it works smooth.
Resultly, I stop using LSP-bdidge.
I installed 'all-the-icons-dired' in Emacs. It adds icons to dired-mode, but it took some time for the icons to appear.

After installation, initially, only monochrome icons appeared. So, I set 'all-the-icons-dired monochrome' to nil.

I also encountered an issue with hooking 'all-the-icons-dired-mode' when invoking dired. It turned out I misspelled something in 'config.el', which took some time to identify.

Furthermore, the folder icons were displaying as file icons, and the PDF file icon looked like a garbage box, which seemed odd. So, I switched to 'nerd-icons-dired'. Finally, it achieved the appearance I desired."
