today, I watched a movie about denote. It occrured me how to write the denote.
It can write jouranl. I wrote every journal in org-capture.

But I knew about denote-journal. Which should I use org-capture journal or denote-journal?

Let's test denote-journal.
I want to watch more video about denote.

I forget. I watched about meta note. I must create 'the meta-note'.
This above is sample note. it's not metanote. I think I use a `refile.org` .
I correct onto the file to all of my note.

It heard ridiculas? Yes, I think so. But many people do so.
