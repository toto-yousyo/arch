I installed ox-hugo to Emacs. I want to write my blog in Emacs and publish it to my blog. Same as until now, I installed it but it's not working. I refactored my blog entries but haven't published any yet. They're all in one org file named journal.org.

I'm supposed to write in this single file and then publish them as separate .md files. I added PROPERTIES to every subtree, but an error occurred and it didn't publish. It said, "You don't have #+title." So I tried revising some code, but it didn't work.

Finally, I found out that in the PROPERTIES, ":END:'s" was missing the right ":". After adding ":", it worked. But then I realized I also mistyped again.
