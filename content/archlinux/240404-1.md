Today, I test emacs more. I can't open file, can't install packages.
I only install yasnippet, Lsp-bridge.
I can recognize about keybinding, how to install packages from package manager better than ever before.
But concern with org-mode, I forget many tips, keybind. so worth than ever before.

I think it is waste so much if I use only either emacs or vim. The more I use these, it become more interesting. And, The text editer is not only these two. We have vscode, Helix, kakoune. I have interest about kakoune. I will try it.
