I faced emacs cpu usage 100% problem.
emacs became very slow.
so I check cpu usage, and emacs's cpu usage is 100%,
and many python3 running.
I can't say correctly, however 3 result of org-babel code block
including RESULT.
I deleted some code block including RESULT from file.
and it works smooth.
Resultly, I stop using LSP-bdidge.
I installed 'all-the-icons-dired' in Emacs. It adds icons to dired-mode, but it took some time for the icons to appear.

After installation, initially, only monochrome icons appeared. So, I set 'all-the-icons-dired monochrome' to nil.

I also encountered an issue with hooking 'all-the-icons-dired-mode' when invoking dired. It turned out I misspelled something in 'config.el', which took some time to identify.

Furthermore, the folder icons were displaying as file icons, and the PDF file icon looked like a garbage box, which seemed odd. So, I switched to 'nerd-icons-dired'. Finally, it achieved the appearance I desired."
