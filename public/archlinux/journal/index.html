I’m particularly excited about its ability to easily insert code blocks into Org files, as this will streamline my workflow.\nIn addition to code snippets, Yankpad can also handle a wide range of text snippets, such as boilerplate email templates. Today, I plan to create a set of snippets specifically for email templates, which should save me a lot of time and effort in the long run.\nAnother aspect of Org-mode that I’m exploring is literate programming. I’ve created an Emacs configuration file in Org format (config.org) and have been experimenting with executing Org-babel to generate the corresponding config.el file. This process has been surprisingly straightforward, thanks to Org-mode’s powerful capabilities.\nOne feature that I find particularly useful is the ability to selectively tangle (execute) code blocks within the Org file. By setting the tangle property to “no” for specific blocks, I can omit them from the generated config.el file. This flexibility allows me to include code snippets for reference purposes without necessarily executing them.\n## Embracing Emacs and Org-mode\nInitially, I had considered using Neovim, as it seemed like a more modern and “cooler” option compared to Emacs. However, after spending some time with Org-mode and experiencing its powerful features firsthand, I’ve come to appreciate the superiority of Emacs in this domain.\nOrg-mode’s capabilities for task management, note-taking, and literate programming have won me over, and I’ve decided to fully embrace Emacs as my primary text editor and productivity tool. While Neovim may have its strengths, the depth and versatility of Org-mode make Emacs an unbeatable choice for my workflow.\nAs I continue to delve deeper into Emacs and Org-mode, I’m excited to uncover more hidden gems and streamline my productivity even further.\nTODO Exhausted day, today iPhone :PROPERTIES: :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 240411-1 :EXPORT_DATE: 2024-04-11 :END Exhausted day, today.

It occrured me how to write the denote. It can write jouranl. I wrote every journal in org-capture.\nBut I knew about denote-journal. Which should I use org-capture journal or denote-journal?\nLet’s test denote-journal. I want to watch more video about denote.\nI forget. I watched about meta note. I must create ’the meta-note’. This above is sample note. it’s not metanote. I think I use a refile.org . I correct onto the file to all of my note.\nIt heard ridiculas? Yes, I think so.

But this (Prop. vii.) is absurd. Therefore God necessarily exists.\n\"\"\"\nHow can I change a bunch of text like above, by using regular expression? Chat GPT Yes, you can achieve this transformation using Emacs’s find and replace functionality with regular expressions. Here’s how you can do it:\nOpen your text file in Emacs. Press `Ctrl + %` query-replace-regexp to initiate the search and replace operation. Emacs will prompt you for the text or regular expression to search for. Enter the regular expression that matches the patterns you want to replace. For example, to match lines starting with “prop.”, you can use ^prop\\..*?$. Press `Enter`. Emacs will prompt you for the replacement text. Enter the replacement string with the desired formatting, using \\\u0026 to refer to the entire matched text. For example, to replace the matched lines with **** \\\u0026, enter that as the replacement string. Press `Enter` again to perform the replacement. Repeat steps 3-6 for each pattern you want to replace, adjusting the regular expressions and replacement strings as needed. Remember to use regular expression syntax for your patterns, and escape special characters as necessary.\nI\nBut, It was not enough. I added few regexp and done.\n\\*\\*\\*\\* PROP \\. [A-Z]+\\. -\u003e \\\u0026 ^J(press C-q,C-j) It can change to return and make sentence. \\\u0026 means refer to the entire matched text.\nTODO stacking emacs course for RESULT. :PROPERTIES: :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 240414-1 :EXPORT_DATE: 2024-04-14 :END I faced emacs cpu usage 100% problem. emacs became very slow. so I check cpu usage, and emacs’s cpu usage is 100%, and many python3 running. I can’t say correctly, however 3 result of org-babel code block including RESULT. I deleted some code block including RESULT from file. and it works smooth. Resultly, I stop using LSP-bdidge. I installed ‘all-the-icons-dired’ in Emacs. It adds icons to dired-mode, but it took some time for the icons to appear.\nAfter installation, initially, only monochrome icons appeared. So, I set ‘all-the-icons-dired monochrome’ to nil.\nI also encountered an issue with hooking ‘all-the-icons-dired-mode’ when invoking dired. It turned out I misspelled something in ‘config.el’, which took some time to identify.\nFurthermore, the folder icons were displaying as file icons, and the PDF file icon looked like a garbage box, which seemed odd. So, I switched to ’nerd-icons-dired’. Finally, it achieved the appearance I desired.\"\n","wordCount":"1612","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"toto-yousyo"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://yousyo.com/archlinux/journal/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"toto arch linux","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://yousyo.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://yousyo.com/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://yousyo.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://yousyo.com/archlinux/ title=ArchLinux><span>ArchLinux</span></a></li><li><a href=https://yousyo.com/books/ title=Books><span>Books</span></a></li><li><a href=https://yousyo.com/writing/ title=Writing><span>Writing</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://yousyo.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://yousyo.com/archlinux/>Archlinuxes</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">test Emac doom to wsl</h1><div class=post-meta>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1612 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;toto-yousyo</div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=test-emacs>Test Emacs<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#test-emacs>#</a></h2><p>:PROPERTIES:

I faced emacs cpu usage 100% problem.
emacs became very slow.
so I check cpu usage, and emacs&rsquo;s cpu usage is 100%,
and many python3 running.
I can&rsquo;t say correctly, however 3 result of org-babel code block
including RESULT.
I deleted some code block including RESULT from file.
and it works smooth.
Resultly, I stop using LSP-bdidge.
I installed &lsquo;all-the-icons-dired&rsquo; in Emacs. It adds icons to dired-mode, but it took some time for the icons to appear.</p><p>After installation, initially, only monochrome icons appeared. So, I set &lsquo;all-the-icons-dired monochrome&rsquo; to nil.</p><p>I also encountered an issue with hooking &lsquo;all-the-icons-dired-mode&rsquo; when invoking dired. It turned out I misspelled something in &lsquo;config.el&rsquo;, which took some time to identify.</p><p>Furthermore, the folder icons were displaying as file icons, and the PDF file icon looked like a garbage box, which seemed odd. So, I switched to &rsquo;nerd-icons-dired&rsquo;. Finally, it achieved the appearance I desired."</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yousyo.com/archlinux/240105/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Arch Linuxはじめてみた</span></a></nav></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://yousyo.com/>toto arch linux</a></span>
